          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Welcome to my site! I have created my site in order to help my friends learn how to code,
              play music, and other things that I will learn along the way.
              I am not an expert on all of these things, but I hope you will find benefit in this web page.
              Thank you and God bless you.</p>
