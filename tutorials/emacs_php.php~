     <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>Making in websites in HTML is good, but I have noticed that
       there is allot of code repetition. To solve this issue I have begun using
       more php in my web pages. A great way to test your php is to setup a local
       web server on your computer. This tutorial will teach you how to set up a
       <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29'>LAMP Server</a> in ubuntu linux.</p>

     <h2 id='step1'>Install Apache2 on Ubuntu Linux</h2>
     <p>According to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server'>Wikipedia</a>: The Apache HTTP Server,
       colloquially called Apache (/əˈpætʃiː/ ə-PA-chee),
       is the world's most used web server software.
       Originally based on the NCSA HTTPd server,
       development of Apache began in early 1995 after work on the NCSA code stalled.
       Apache played a key role in the initial growth of the World Wide Web,[5]
       quickly overtaking NCSA HTTPd as the dominant HTTP server,
       and has remained most popular since April 1996. In 2009,
       it became the first web server software to serve more than 100 million websites.[6] </p>
